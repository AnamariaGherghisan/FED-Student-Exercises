//Explanation:

//The JavaScript code defines the generatePassword() function responsible for generating a random password.
//The length variable is set to 8, indicating the desired length of the password. This value can be changed 
//to set a different length.
//The charset variable is a string containing all the characters to be included in the password. 
//It includes letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters. This string it can be  modified to add or remove
// characters as desired.
//The password variable is initialized as an empty string.
//A for loop is used to generate each character of the password.
//Inside the loop, a random index is generated
//
function generatePassword() {
  var length = 8; // The desired length of the password
  var charset = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()_-+="; // The characters to include in the password
  var password = "";

  for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * charset.length);
    password += charset.charAt(randomIndex);
  }

  document.getElementById("password").value = password;
}
